{Moderator}
- Meeting to discuss the data science project
- Introductions of the team members

{John}
- Leading the project
- Project is about predicting customer churn for a telecom company
- Dataset contains customer information, services subscribed, and usage patterns
- Goal is to build a model that can predict which customers are likely to leave
- Need to clean and pre-process the data before building the model
- Thinking of trying out popular algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests for predictive modeling

{Sarah}
- Has experience in data cleaning and pre-processing
- Asked for more details about the dataset

{Mark}
- Data analyst
- Will help with data cleaning and visualization
- Asked for specific requirements for data cleaning

{Emily}
- Machine learning engineer
- Will work on the predictive modeling part of the project
- Asked about which algorithms to use and how to evaluate their performance

{Moderator}
- Wraps up the meeting
- Will reconvene next week to discuss progress
