[00:00:00] Jules: [to Brett] Do you read the Bible, Brett?

[00:00:04] Brett: [nervously] Yes.

[00:00:06] Jules: Well, there's this passage I've got memorized. It sort of fits the occasion. Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he, who in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness. For he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you."

[00:00:44] Jules: [pulls out his gun] Now, I've been sayin' that shiz for years. And if you heard it, that meant your ass. I never really questioned what it meant. I thought it was just a cold-blooded thing to say to a mother* before I popped a cap in his ass. But I saw some shiz this morning made me think twice.

[00:01:05] Vincent: [nods]

[00:01:06] Jules: Now I'm thinkin': it could mean you're the evil man. And I'm the righteous man. And Mr. 9mm here, he's the shepherd protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness. Or it could be you're the righteous man and I'm the shepherd and it's the world that's evil and selfish. I'd like that. But that shiz ain't the truth. The truth is you're the weak. And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to be the shepherd.

[00:02:10] Jules: [to Brett] Oh, I'm sorry. Did I break your concentration? I didn't mean to do that. Please, continue. You were saying something about "best intentions"?

[00:02:30] Brett: [nervously] What...

[00:02:32] Jules: [interrupts Brett] What? What ain't no country I ever heard of! They speak English in What?

[00:02:40] Brett: [nervously] What?

[00:02:42] Jules: [loudly] English, mother*! Do you speak it?

[00:02:45] Brett: [terrified] Yes!

[00:02:47] Jules: Then you understand what I'm saying?

[00:02:50] Brett: Yes.

[00:02:52] Jules: Now describe what Marcellus Wallace looks like.

[00:03:00] Brett: What?

[00:03:02] Jules: [frustrated, pointing the gun at Brett] Say "what" again! Say "what" again! I dare you! I double dare you, mother*! Say "what" one more goddamn time!

[00:03:12] Brett: [frightened] He's...he's black...

[00:03:15] Jules: [nods] Go on!

[00:03:18] Brett: He's...he's bald...

[00:03:22] Jules: Does he look like a b*?

[00:03:24] Brett: [panicked] What?

[00:03:26] Jules: [shoots Brett in the shoulder] Does he look...like a b*?

[00:03:34] Brett: [in pain] No!
